# Sudoku Solver Project
Personal project that solve a sudoku. It gives all the solutions.
I'm still working on graphics, therefore, after the call of the "solve" method, you will see the solutions on your console. If you put few numbers in the matrix, the program will crash... too many solutions (i need to fix this)
