# Sudoku Solver Game
         I hope the font thing works. But ,anyways, basically this "game"
         gives you all the solutions of a Sudoku. If you insert
         few numbers there can be more than one solution. Most of the
         classes in this project were made for Graphics. If you want
         to see the core of the Sudoku solving process see only the
         class : Sudoku.java (the rest is just pure graphic stuff
         if you want to see the Graphic part run SudokuGame.java)

         I still need to fix some things, because there is a possibility
         in which the program "can't solve" the Sudoku (too many solution)
         but that's fixable. Anyways enjoy it :3
